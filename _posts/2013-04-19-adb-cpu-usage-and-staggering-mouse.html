After tuning my system to develop an Android app, I noticed that every time ADB (Android Debug Bridge) daemon was started, the mouse cursor (and all graphics for that matter, as well as other I/O tasks like playing music) in my GNU/Linux system would start flickering, staggering, jumping, get slow, I'm not even sure what to call it. Besides that, the CPU usage was always around 2% to 7% (if seen from KSysGuard, lower using <code>ps</code>).  <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="258" src="/assets/adb-cpu-usage.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; text-align: start;">KSysGuard shows the ADB daemon consuming an average 4% CPU time</span></td></tr></tbody></table><a name='more'></a>After monitoring the <code>adb</code> process and system I/O operations, I noticed that the problem was probably related to ADB polling the host USB devices periodically. That made me think of the disastrous xHCI controller from Fresco Logic, which I have in my computer for providing USB 3.0 connectivity, that had already given me problems before.<br /><br />For now, what I do to avoid this issue when I need ADB is simply unloading the kernel module <code>xhci_hcd</code>:  <br /><pre class="prettyprint">sudo modprobe -r xhci_hcd</pre>If I didn't want to use my USB 3.0 port I would just blacklist the module.  <br /><br />If you have this issue, post a comment or contact me so we can have a further chat and possibly get more insight.
