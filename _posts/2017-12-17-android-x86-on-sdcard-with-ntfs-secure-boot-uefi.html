<p>Android-x86 on SD card with NTFS, Secure Boot
and UEFI</p>

<span style="display: block; text-align: center"><img src="/assets/android-x86.png"/ style="width: 50%"></span>

<p>I will show you how to install the 64-bit
version of Android-x86 7.1rc2 (and likely other versions such as CM14.1 rc1, or
other operating systems based on Android-x86 such as RemixOS), on a SD/microSD
card using NTFS as the filesystem (thus providing a fast Android experience)
with Secure Boot and UEFI boot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the tutorials available on the web show
how to install Android-x86 on a USB storage device. Even though I was able to
find some information about how to install on a microSD card reader, I found no
information whatsoever about doing so together with:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>What to do when the microSD card can be booted
but Android-x86 never gets “detected”.</p>

<p>Using NTFS as the filesystem for storing
Android-x86’s virtual partitions was a priority for me, since I originally
tested Android-x86 on a cheap USB stick and observed that the
performance/latency difference of EXT4 or FAT32 vs. NTFS was jaw-dropping, with
the EXT4 or FAT32 being almost unusable.</p>

<p>I mentioned not giving up Secure Boot when using
NTFS. Well, I would eventually have made the effort to give up Secure Boot in
order to use Android-x86 with NTFS. However, I simply was not successful in
booting to GRUB when using the card, but was successful when using the USD
drive. Using the card simply printed the following and froze:</p>

<p>The computer I have used for my installation was
the Dell Latitude 7480, and from what I can gather any Dell E7x40, E7x50,
E7x60, E7x70, 7x80 should work the same way, if not many others from Dell. I
can’t guarantee that this post will work with your computer even if the above 2
points tick, since it will depend on the manufacturer of the card reader, as
well as whether Linux kernel modules are available for it in Android-x86.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will mention keyboard shortcuts, terminology,
screens and show photographs from the Dell Latitude 7480. If you are using a
different laptop, you’ll need to find the equivalent items. I will also mention
microSD specifically from now on, since that’s the card type this laptop can
read.</p>

<p>The microSD card needs to have either a GPT or a
MS-DOS partition table (I have used and tested MS-DOS, but GPT should work as
well).</p>

<p>Then make sure the card has the following
partitions in the following order:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
lang=EN-US>(optional) NTFS/FAT32/exFAT partition to be read by both Android and
Windows/Linux – whatever capacity makes sense to you. It is VERY IMPORTANT that
this partition be the first partition on the list, otherwise Windows will not
be able to see it (Linux will still do the job).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
lang=EN-US>All the remaining space should be converted to an NTFS partition
with at least 4GB (the less you have here, the quicker Android will run
out-of-space and become unstable… 4GB is extremely little in case you intend to
install some of the most popular apps, to illustrate)</p>

<p>When you are faced with the list of
devices/partitions where you can install Android-x86, you might notice that the
partitions of your microSD card are missing (they are in the Dell Latitude
7480). This depends on the manufacturer of the microSD card reader but my
expectation is that they will be missing more often than not. In order to make
the partitions show up on the list, the correct kernel module for the card
reader needs to be loaded. For the Dell Latitude 7480 the module name is <span
lang=EN-US>rtsx_pci_sdmmc>,
but it may be different in other computers. One way to find the name of the
module is to launch another Linux-based OS such as Ubuntu or Parted Magic and
running the following commands to inspect their output and obtain the name of
the module:</p>

<p>$ lsmod | grep –i sd</p>

<p>$ lsmod | grep –i mmc</p>

<p>$ lspci –kv | grep –<span lang=IT>i card</p>

<p>Or by finding out the module driving
/dev/mmcblk0p1, for example. You can check here for more information: <span
class=Hyperlink0>><a
href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/97676/how-to-find-the-driver-module-associated-with-a-device-on-linux">https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/97676/how-to-find-the-driver-module-associated-with-a-device-on-linux</a></p>

<p>Once you know the module name, in my case <span
lang=EN-US>rtsx_pci_sdmmc>,
just boot the Android-x86 usb drive again and, once on the list of partitions,
press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to tty2 and run the following command (modify
accordingly):</p>

<p>$ modprobe 
style='font-family:Consolas'>rtsx_pci_sdmmc</p>

<p>Then press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go back to tty1 (where
the list of partitions is), and select “Detect devices”. Hopefully, the 2/3
partitions of your microSD card will now show up and will probably be called
mmcblk0p1 and mmcblk0p2 and mmcblk0p3. The numbers will reflect the order of
the partitions you created earlier (first to last), and the filesystem type
will also give you another indication as to which partition is which.</p>

<p>Choose the microSD card NTFS partition as the
destination of the Android-x86 installation. (show image)</p>

<p class=Body>>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked if you want to install EFI GRUB, say
yes.</p>

<p>When asked if you want to make the /system
partition read+write, say yes.</p>

<p>When asked how big you want the /data partition
to be, make it about 1500MB if you chose to have a 4GB NTFS partition. For
every additional GB your NTFS partition has, add an additional 1024MB to the
/data partition size. I am using an NTFS partition with 23GB and my /data has a
capacity of 20GB. If the microSD card isn’t very fast, you might want to try
with only 600MB to make it quicker just so you can check if Android-x86 works
in the end (and then repeat the installation with more space for /data).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then wait from a few minutes to more than an
hour, depending on the /data size and the microSD card speed.</p>

<p>When finished, select Reboot. However,
Android-x86 won’t work out-of-the-box after rebooting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><span
lang=EN-US>Making it boot</b></p>

<p class=Body><b>>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>At this point, Android-x86 is already installed
on the microSD card. However, the USB installation drive/media will be used one
more time in the next section, so keep it around.</p>

<p>To make Android boot there are 2 important
issues that need to be corrected (might be only 1 in some cases):</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>Just like 
style='font-family:Consolas'>rtsx_pci_sdmmc> (or another
module) was missing during installation, so will it when Android-x86 attempts
to boot (the initial ramdisk that GRUB loads, which is then supposed to load
the rest of operating system, will not include the microSD card reader kernel
module by default,  and so will simply fail by getting stuck in “Detecting
Android-x86…………………………”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>Additionally, the initial ramdisk (initrd.img)
and related files (kernel and ramdisk.img) will be present in the NTFS
partition but GRUB will not be able to read from the NTFS partition because 1)
GRUB was not installed with the NTFS GRUB module and 2) even if it was (or if
manually installed), Secure Boot will prevent GRUB from reading non-FAT
partitions. So, with Secure Boot disabled, one could copy the ntfs.mod from
another GRUB and then issue “insmod ntfs” and “set root=’(hd0,3)’ assuming the
card reader is hd0, before the existing GRUB commands for the Android-x86 boot
entry, and it would work (but again, Secure Boot needs to be disabled).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point, go back to your Linux
installation or Linux live image.</p>

<p>There, 3 things have to be done with regards to
the partitions and files from Android-x86:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>Extract the Android-x86 squashfs image in order
to search and copy necessary kernel modules</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>Copy missing kernel modules to the initrd image</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
>Copy new initrd image, kernel and ramdisk files
to the FAT16 partition instead of the NTFS partition</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:0in'>>The next
section will go through all of this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><span
lang=EN-US>Get the necessary kernel modules</b></p>

<p>To get the necessary kernel modules for booting
Android-x86 (only rtsx_pci_sdmmc and its dependency rtsx_pci in my scenario –
you should look for the dependencies of the modules you need using the lsmod
command), the Android-x86 live squashfs image should first be extracted so that
you can access its files. So plug in the live USB drive and mount it in your
Linux system. Then follow the following steps:</p>

<p>$ cd &amp;&amp; mkdir sfs # create a directory
locally to store the squashfs contents</p>

<p>$ cp /path/to/android_x86_live/system.sfs ~ #
copy the system.sfs squashfs file</p>

<p>$ cd &amp;&amp; unsquashfs system.sfs # extract
the image from it</p>

<p>$ mount -t ext4 system.img sfs # mount it to the
directory we created earlier</p>

<p>$ cd
~/sfs/lib/modules/4.9.54-android-x86_64-gfb63269e5ada/kernel # change kernel
version here accordingly, if not using 7.1rc2</p>

<p>$ find . -name *rtsx* # find the path to the
missing module (and similarly named ones)</p>

<p>./drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_pci_ms.ko</p>

<p>./drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.ko</p>

<p>./drivers/mfd/rtsx_pci.ko               # yep, I
need this one</p>

<p>./drivers/mfd/rtsx_usb.ko</p>

<p>./drivers/mmc/host/rtsx_pci_sdmmc.ko    # yep, I
need this one</p>

<p>./drivers/mmc/host/rtsx_usb_sdmmc.ko</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You now know where the needed modules are, so
let’s temporarily switch to something else: getting the original initrd image
in order to later update it with the additional modules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>$ cd &amp;&amp; mkdir initrd # create a
directory locally to store the initrd<span lang=FR> contents</p>

<p>$ cp /path/to/android_ntfs_partition/android-7.1-rc2/initrd.img
initrd/ # copy the initrd file</p>

<p>$ cd initrd &amp;&amp; mv initrd.img initrd.gz</p>

<p>$ <span lang=DE>gunzip initrd.gz</p>

<p>$ cpio -id &lt; initrd # extract the
cpio-archived initrd image</p>

<p>$ rm initrd</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initrd image is now extracted, so you can
modify it as needed. In terms of the microSD card reader kernel module, the 2
modules above will be copied to initrd and will be loaded by changing one of
the scripts (the same one that issues the “Detecting Android-x86” message).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>$ cd
~/sfs/lib/modules/4.9.54-android-x86_64-gfb63269e5ada/kernel</p>

<p>$ <span lang=NL>cp <span
lang=EN-US>./drivers/mfd/rtsx_pci.ko ~/initrd/lib/modules/</p>

<p>$ cp ./drivers/mmc/host/rtsx_pci_sdmmc.ko
~/initrd/lib/modules/</p>

<p>$ vim ~/initrd/init # use any editor you feel
comfortable to edit this file</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the init file, look for the following:</p>

<p class=Body><span lang=PT>echo -n Detecting Android-x86…</p>

<p class=Body><span lang=PT>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before that (should be around line 135), add the
following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body><span lang=ES-TRAD>echo &quot;Loading SD card <span
lang=EN-US>reader modules (rtsx_pci, rtsx_pci_sdmmc)… (credit:
igordc.com)&quot;</p>

<p>busybox insmod /lib/modules/rtsx_pci.ko</p>

<p>busybox insmod /lib/modules/rtsx_pci_sdmmc.ko</p>

<p>sleep 2</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What these lines do is to simply load the
modules manually, from where we copied them to (although from the perspective
of the initial ramdisk already running, so don’t doubt that the paths are
correct in the lines above).</p>

<p>Change the message in the “echo” line however
you want, or remove it.</p>

<p class=Body>>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that the initrd image is finally ready, it’s
time to turn it back into a single file.</p>

<p>$ >cd ~/initrd</p>

<p>$ find . >| cpio -o -H newc
| gzip &gt; ../initrd.img</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body>And copy that file, along with the ramdisk and kernel files that
are in the NTFS partition, into the FAT16 partition. This will make GRUB find
the files even if Secure Boot is disabled or the NTFS GRUB module is not
present.</p>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body>$ mkdir />path/to/android_fat16_partition/android-7.1-rc2</p>

<p class=Body>$ cp ~/initrd.img />path/to/android_fat16_partition/android-7.1-rc2/</p>

<p>$ cp />path/to/android_ntfs_partition/android-7.1-rc2/ramdisk

<p>$ cp />path/to/android_ntfs_partition/android-7.1-rc2/kernel
/>path/to/android_fat16_partition/android-7.1-rc2/kernel</p>

<p class=Body>>&nbsp;</p>
