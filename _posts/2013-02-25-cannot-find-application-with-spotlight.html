As a recent user to the Apple world, I've been exploring and optimizing the OS X based on my needs. After playing with my OS X installation I ended up losing access to some applications (native ones!). I managed to restore them by copying the files from another OS X installation. However, Spotlight couldn't find the applications anymore. I searched for solutions but all I got was disappointment. So, I decided to fix it myself and share it with you.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="107" src="/assets/spotlight-cannot-find.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Spotlight cannot find an application that is installed</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a name='more'></a>After non-deliberately deleting some native applications I restored them&nbsp;by copying the files from another OS X installation. However, Spotlight couldn't find the applications anymore (but I could run them).<br /><div><br /></div><div>I tried multiple ways to rebuild the Spotlight index as suggested in the community. Nothing did it.</div><div><br /></div><div>It turns out that the applications had a wrong set of permissions which made them invisible to Spotlight.</div><div><br /></div><div>After observing the other native applications' files I discovered that:</div><div><ul><li>The main application directory and all its contents must belong to the user <code>root</code> and group <code>wheel</code>;</li><li>The main application directory and all directories recursively inside of it must have a set of permissions equal to <code>755</code> (Traditional Unix permissions);</li><li>All files recursively inside the main application directory must have a set of permissions equal to <code>644</code>;&nbsp;</li><li>The file inside the <code>Contents/MacOS/</code> from the main directory must have the set of permissions <code>755</code> because it must be executable or the application won't run;</li></ul><div>The most important aspect is that the file <code>Contents/Info.plist</code>&nbsp;be readable in the <i>others class</i> so that Spotlight can view it.<br /><br /><br />Now that we know the theoretical aspects of the issue, let's delve into some Terminal exercise:<br /><br /><ol><li>Open up Terminal and <code>cd</code> to the directory containing the main directory of the application you want to fix, e.g: <code>cd /Applications/Utilities</code>. Let's assume the application is called MyApp and its main directory <code>MyApp.app</code>;</li><li>Set the right owner and group to every file and directory: <code>sudo chown -R root:wheel MyApp.app</code>;</li><li>Set the general permissions to every file and directory: <code>sudo chmod -R 775 MyApp.app</code>;</li><li>Change the permissions of only the files: <code>find MyApp.app -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 644</code>;</li><li>Change the permissions of the actual executable file, to be executable: <code>sudo chmod 775 MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp</code>;</li></ol>Although it doesn't need to be exactly like this, these steps get your application consistent with the other ones.<br /><br />If the application still doesn't show up in Spotlight, try to force a rebuild of its database:<br /><br /><pre class="code">mdutil -E</pre></div></div><br /><b>Update:</b>&nbsp;Some application files may require specific permissions. Run Disk Utility to verify and repair the disk files' permissions.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><b><br /></b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_permissions#Traditional_Unix_permissions">Traditional Unix permissions</a>
