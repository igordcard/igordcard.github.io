It is official, this blog is now hosted at http://blog.igordcard.com. Besides the change of domain, the platform has also been migrated from Blogger to Jekyll, hosted in GitHub Pages. This decision will allow me to maintain the pages with more ease and flexibility, leveraging most of the benefits of using git. All comments have been migrated to Disqus and are already displayed in the new platform.
