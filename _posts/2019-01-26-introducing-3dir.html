<p>Today I am introducing the 3Dir (Dynamic Download Directories) Google Chrome extension by releasing a pre-alpha version at the Chrome Web Store.</p><span style="display: block; text-align: center"><img src="/assets/3dir_promo3.png" width="80%"/></span><br/><h4 id="3dir">Dynamic Download Directories</h4><p>The goal of 3Dir is very straightforward: to save your downloads in different locations based on different attributes and conditions... so you don't have to waste time doing it by hand.</p>

<p>As of today, <a id="3dir_store" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/3dir-dynamic-download-dir/miiniiahifdfcapppoecnajdjjolemao">pre-alpha version 0.1.0.0</a> is available at the Chrome Web Store [1]. This very first version includes the most basic, but personally most useful, feature I could think of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>always move your download to a folder named the same as the domain name of the download's URL</b></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the user decides to download 3Dir's release zipfile from GitHub, a directory named "github.com" is automatically created inside the root Downloads folder and 3Dir's release zipfile gets saved there.</p>

<p>Apart from automatically saving downloads that result from clicking on a download link, the extension also moves downloaded files in other types of interactions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choosing to "Save link as..."</li>
    <li>Choosing to "Save image as..."</li>
    <li>Choosing to save a non-webpage using "Save as", such as PDF document or an image</li>
    <li>Using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-page-we/dhhpefjklgkmgeafimnjhojgjamoafof">Save Page WE</a> [2] extension that downloads the current page as a single HTML file</li>
    <li>Likely other interactions work as well</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when choosing to save a webpage, either by using the CTRL+S shortcut (or whichever is assigned) or "Save as...", will not activate 3Dir.</p>

<h4 id="store">Chrome Web Store listing for v0.1.0.0</h4>

<p>Dynamic Download Directories (pre-alpha)</p>

<p>This is 3Dir: an extension that dynamically moves/renames your downloads to directories according to your specified criteria.</p>

<p>This is a pre-alpha release. It only does 1 thing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>always moves your download to a folder named the same as the domain name of download's URL</li>
</ul>

<p>This has been tested for normal binary downloads and for webpages downloaded using the "Save Page WE" Chrome extension. CTRL+S behavior is not overridden.</p>

<p>Feedback is welcome: do it at the project's GitHub page (click Website - [3]).</p>
