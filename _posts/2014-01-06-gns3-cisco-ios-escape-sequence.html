If you want to use the escape sequence in IOS in order to cancel pending commands (like a ping or a traceroute), using GNS3, and you're trying to use Ctrl+Shift+6 or Ctrl+C or any other combination that is supposed to work, as far as you can tell from the web, then just try Ctrl+6, it will probably work.
